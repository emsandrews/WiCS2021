##About Us

UBC WiCS is a student led club at the University of British Columbia. We aim to build a strong community of women in Computer Science at UBC. We seek to empower women* by providing opportunities to build lasting connections with other women in tech, and supporting each other as we progress through our time at UBC!

This website was built by Emily Andrews to promote the UBCWiCS organization.
